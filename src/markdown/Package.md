# ðŸ“¦ What are Packages?

Packages in Roblox let us share folders across different branches and workspaces. If you change something inside a package and **publish it**, anyone else can **sync** those changes into their own workspace automatically!

This is **super important** for our workflow at Dress to Impress, where everyone works in their own private branch (like their own copy of the game). Without packages, people would constantly overwrite each otherâ€™s work. Packages solve that.

## ðŸ§  Why We Use Packages

Hereâ€™s a real-world DTI example:

- Nick updates a script inside the `Modules` folder in his own branch.
- Kyle is working on something else in **his** branch, but still needs Nick's updated code.
- Because `Modules` is a shared **package**, Kyle can just **sync** and get the changes automatically!

No more copy/pasting. No more overwriting each otherâ€™s work. âœ…

## ðŸ—‚ Example: Modules Package

Hereâ€™s what a typical **Modules** package looks like inside Roblox Studio:

![Modules Package](../../assets/PackageImage.png)

> This is a shared folder that contains Lua modules used in multiple places across the game.  
> Any time someone changes a script inside it and **publishes** it, others can **pull** the update.

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step: Publishing a Package

If you made a change to a shared asset (like a UI element, model, or script), youâ€™ll want to **publish** the package so others can get it.

Hereâ€™s how:

1. Right-click the package folder in the Explorer
2. Click `Publish Package` â†’ `Publish Changes`

![Publish Package](../../assets/PublishPackage.png)

> This uploads your version of the folder so everyone else can sync it.

## ðŸ”„ Step-by-Step: Syncing a Package

If someone else made changes to a shared package, youâ€™ll want to **sync** to get their new version.

Hereâ€™s how:

1. Right-click the package folder in your Explorer
2. Click `Package` â†’ `Update to Latest Version`

![Sync Package](../../assets/SyncPackage.png)

> This pulls down the latest version that was published by your teammates.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

- **Packages** are folders shared across branches
- You can **publish** your changes so others can get them
- You can **sync** to stay up to date with everyone else
- Used for: `Modules`, `UIAssets`, `3D Models`, etc.
- Keeps everyone in sync and avoids reintroducing bugs
